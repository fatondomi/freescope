This is the repository that stores all the software developed for creating an oscilloscope out of an Arduino board.

The way the oscilloscope works is that it uses an arduino to read analog data and send it to a windows form app.

The windows form and the arduino ino program are ready for you to download.

There is also the already compiled app you can use instead of opening it with VS.

You can build your own oscilloscope by following the wiring diagram of the electric circuit.
